WhaXe
=====

Open source web framework close to Symfony2, for haXe.
Project is just started, documentation will come soon :)

You need to have [WhaXe-Commands](https://github.com/Peekmo/WhaXe-Commands) compiled in your project folder to make it works. 

__Easy compilation to PHP and Neko for the same Haxe Code ! :)__
